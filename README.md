# Apoptotic Cellular Automata (ACA)

This repository is a work in progress. Currently, the plan is to develop a web application that can generate cellular automata using Rust and WebAssembly (wasm). Future work may include using WebGL to render the automata in 3D.

## Test

`cargo test`

## Build

`cargo build --release`
